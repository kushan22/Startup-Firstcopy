# Startup-Firstcopy
<strong>
First Copy is a startup that me and my friend Sameer started back in 2017. 
It was an e-commerce application to connect instagram sellers to customers. It basically gave customers a platform to search the product catalog and connect with Instagram    sellers in a secure way. We used third party delivery partners to take the products from sellers and deliver it to the customers. 
The app gained a lot of attention quickly and became top 10 Trending apps in e-commerce on Google Playstore. 
This app had more than 400,000 downloads. 
  
I am making the source code public since we are not supporting the startup anymore.
